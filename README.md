# Data Science Projects

**Project Overview:**
Welcome to my data science project repository! Here, I showcase a collection of projects that I undertook during my journey of mastering data science. Throughout this process, I gained proficiency in Python and explored a diverse range of libraries, including Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, TensorFlow, and more. My objective was to acquire a comprehensive understanding of data science, encompassing its various methodologies and workflows.

**Learning Journey:**
These projects were completed as part of my data science education, which I pursued through a course offered by Tutedudeâ€”an initiative founded by IIT Delhi alumni. This educational experience provided me with valuable insights and knowledge, enhancing my data science skills and preparing me for real-world applications.
